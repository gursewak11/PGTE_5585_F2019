# What are Smart Objects, Anyway?

This is not so much a question about what people today are calling smart objects, but a starting point for coming to a collective understanding of what we would like a smart object to be.

As we progress through Physical Computing, I want you to be constantly thinking about:

* how to we define smart?
* what is a smart object?
* are there multiple definitions you can think of?
* do they already exist? where?
* what are some examples of your idea of a smart object?
* what are some examples of your ideal smart object (what you'd like them to be)?
* what should they do?
* how should we interact with them?
* if a thing does what we want it to do, do we really need to understand how?

## There are no wrong answers!

We are building our own image of what a smart object is. Along the way, I hope for us to be able to identify and address some of the blind spots around today's current trend towards smart objects, smart homes, smart cars, smart cities, smart everything.
