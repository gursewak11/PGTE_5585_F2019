# Physical Computing Research Topics (WIP)

Physical computing is a multi disciplinary field where applied computer science, embedded systems, electrical and mechanical engineering, industrial and interaction design, social and material science all intersect. Some of the topics that extend from Physical Computing out into the world, where it is applied, span a diverse field of disciplines.

Topics I'm considering as important to take into account when approaching Physical Computing in the context of an interconnected world of myriad societies include:

## Principles of Design 

* What are some key elements of design or design principles from other fields or disciplines that we can apply to Physical Computing?
* How do we translate them to specific aspects of Physical Computing?
* How can we break down the design processes involved in Physical Computing to better help us understand how to apply these design principles?
* What are some quirky design methodologies that we can e

### Starting Points

>The most important, fundamental principles of design include emphasis, balance and alignment, contrast, repetition, proportion, movement and white space.

--[Meg Reid "The 7 principles of design"](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/principles-of-design/)

>Designers are capable of making words real, expressing an idea in form, color, material, and finish. We truly are tangible storytellers. But having the means to make ideas tangible doesn’t necessarily solve all communication issues—we all speak nuanced languages and carry biases toward the things we already love to hear, see, or experience.

## What are some of the Risks?

In regards to embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT), what are some of the risks that a society deeply enmeshed with Information Technologies face today and may face in the future as technologies like AI/Machine Learning, IoT, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing develop?

* In what ways have they already shaped our notions of the individual and society?
* How do the applications of these technologies bear on the discussion of human rights?
* Do these technologies reflect a shift in power? If so, from whom and to whom? Elaborate.
* What is the current state of IT security? What might this mean for a future of smart cities?
* Who do these technologies benefit and how might they impact those not directly involved in their design?

### Starting points

>Pop quiz: What the heck is a GAN? You might not have heard the term, but you’ve likely seen one in action. From generating images of fake celebrities, to creating training data for self-driving cars, and even recreating suggestive (and weird) nude portraits, GANs are everywhere these days. But what exactly is this bleeding-edge technology, and what can we do with it?

## Is it sustainable?

E-Waste. We still really haven't found a good solution for e-waste?

* What are some design methodologies that take into consideration the afterlife of a product.
* What are some grassroots, community initiatives dealing with the problem of e-waste?
* How are artists and designers thinking about waste as an input in their practices?

### Starting Points

>At its core, a circular economy means that products no longer have a life cycle with a beginning, middle, and end. Therefore, they contribute less waste and can actually add value to their ecosystem. When materials stop being used, they go back into a useful cycle, hence the circular economy.

## Who do these technologies benefit? How?

Smart objects were just the beginning. Now there are talks of building whole cities. These behemoth projects requires huge amounts of investment and buy-in from cities. They are also a good starting point for asking some tough questions we should also be asking of smart objects:

* What is a smart city?
* What are some of the companies pushing them?
* If data is the new oil, what does that make a smart city?

## Does my toilet really need to be wifi enabled?

Does the world need another smart object? Aside from coming with added security risks, concerns over privacy, and environmental impacts, embedded technologies are complex and complicated. How do we assess whether it's appropriate

### Staring Points

>The idea of computers sorting through data and detecting patterns is of great interest for analyzing images like mammograms and colonoscopies, and for interpreting electrocardiograms. But is this really transformative or novel?
