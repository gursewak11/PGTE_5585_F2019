## Welcome to Physical Computing!

This is where we make new connections between the digital and physical, using embedded computation to sense, process and react/respond to the environment.

## Course Syllabus

This is your course manual. Everything you need should be in here. If it isn't get in touch!

## Icebreaker

Physical Computing is a multi-disciplinary pursuit that involves a lot of technical knowledge and skill sets. It's tough, but fun and rewarding. It's even more fun when we do things together. Let's take a moment to get to know each other a little better!

### Interviews

Form pairs and take some time to interview each other.

Write down to responses from your new friend:

* What's your name?
* What do you get most excited about doing?
* What's your degree or area of study?
* What have you been up to the last couple of years?
* What is your vision for the next couple of years?
* What are you most excited to learn in this class?
* What do you want to make/build?
* What scares you the most about taking this class?
* Do you have any super powers?
* What unique talents and skills can you share with your classmates?

### Presentation

Let's go around the room and introduce each other. Give a presentation on your partner and share their interview responses. Don't be shy!

## Overview of Basic Concepts

Physical Computing, according to its wikipedia entry:

>means building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world... In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control electro-mechanical devices such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware.

>Physical Computing intersects the range of activities often referred to in academia and industry as electrical engineering, mechatronics, robotics, computer science, and especially embedded development.

## Inspiration:

Take a moment to explore some projects that connect the physical world to computational systems and visa versa. Find something that inspires you. If you already know of a project that you want to better understand start there.

Create a Report on this project or a collection of projects that relate to your personal interests, that you find inspiring. Publish this on Medium for your first Assignment.
