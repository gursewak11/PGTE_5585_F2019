### Arduino core for ESP8266 WiFi chip

1. Install Arduino IDE 1.8.7 or later.
2. Start the Arduino IDE and open the **Preferences** window.
3. Enter `https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` into the **Additional Board Manager URLs** field.
4. Click **"Tools"** in the menu bar, mouse over **"Boards: ..."**, then click **"Boards Manager"**
5. Enter **"esp8266"** in the filter field and install the board package.

### Connecting to the ESP8266 NodeMCU ESP-12E

Depending on where you got your NodeMCU board, it might have one of a few different chipsets, which may or may not be automatically recognized as a USB device by your computer.

This just means we need to go through some extra steps.

#### Check to see if it's recognized

1. With the Arduino IDE open, connect the NodeMCU board to your computer.
2. Click **"Tools"** in the menu bar, mouse over **"Boards: ..."**, then click **"NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)"**
3. Click **"Tools"** in the menu bar, mouse over **"Port"**
4. If you don't see anything that looks like `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART` or `/dev/tty.wchusbserial14210` or anything else that could possibly be the board, then you need to install the drivers for the board.

#### Installing the SiliconLabs C2102 Driver [MOST LIKELY]
