## Lab Exercises

* Load 'Blink' example to your board
* Modify the 'Blink' example in the following ways
	1. Make it blink slower
	2. Make it blink faster
	3. Add a routine that makes it blink when you close a switch
	4. Modify the routine so that it blinks one speed when one switch is closed and a different speed with another switch is closed

## Timing Tricks

* delay()
* millis()
