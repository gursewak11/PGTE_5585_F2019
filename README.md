### Course Description

The physical and the digital are often thought of as distinct and disparate. This class will be an investigation into notions of physicality and interface with respect to the computer, and an exploration of related analog and digital technology. Students will complete a series of exercises that will encourage inquiry into these various technologies and the implications of a connection between or joining of physical and digital worlds. Basic electronics and various sensor mechanisms will be used in conjunction with toolkits such as Arduino. Students joining this class should be comfortable with code in general, have experience with one programming language or another, and be prepared to solder.
